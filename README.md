# Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my **Web Development Portfolio** repository. This repository is a collection of my backend projects built using **Spring Framework** and **Java**. It serves as a showcase of my skills in developing high-performance, scalable, and secure backend systems. 

### Current Projects

- **Shopease**: An e-commerce platform featuring user authentication, product management, order processing, and an admin dashboard.
- **Blogify**: A blogging platform where users can create, edit, and manage blog posts, as well as interact with content via comments, likes, and shares.

### Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** for building RESTful APIs and backend services
- **Spring Security** for user authentication and authorization
- **JPA / Hibernate** for database interaction
- **MySQL** as the primary database for data storage
- **JWT Authentication** for secure and stateless user authentication

### Upcoming Projects
Stay tuned for more exciting backend projects, as I continue to develop and improve this repository. Future uploads will include more complex systems, integrations, and features.
